They review every detail of the proposed mission, from concept and design, to execution and science application, as well as how the mission personnel from different institutions work together as a team.  \n\nFollowing the site visit, the Principal Investigator presented to NASA’s Associate Administrator.  On January 4 of 2017, the Psyche Mission’s selection for flight was announced by NASA.',
